# m5c-work_day_scheduler
This website is an hourly planner for your workday.

You can set appointments in hour blocks from 9AM to 5PM.

Each hour roww is comprised of the time of you appointment, an input field to describe the appointment, and a save button to move you appointment into memory.

As you save you appointment info the input field will empty, but don't worry a message will pop-up below the planner to confirm each appointment saved.
